This repository contains my personal notes created with Obsidian
 and published using Quartz
 for a clean, browsable web view.

📖 About

- Notes are organized first by subject, then by main topics/milestones.
- Quartz makes them easy to explore with links and a graph view.
- Goal: simple access, sharing, and review of notes.

🚀 Tech

- Obsidian → note-taking and organization
